<h2>Living With Arthritis<br />
Easy-to-Read Information for Patients and Families</h2>

<h3>What Is Arthritis?</h3>

<p>Many people start to feel pain and stiffness in their bodies over 
time. Sometimes their hands or knees or shoulders get sore 
and are hard to move and may become swollen. These people 
may have arthritis (ar-THRY-tis). Arthritis may be caused by 
inflammation (in-flah-MAY-shun) of the tissue lining the joints. 
Some signs of inflammation include redness, heat, pain, and 
swelling. These problems are telling you that something is wrong.</p>

<!--<div class="picRight clear"><img src="graphics/MaleBody.jpg" width="125" height="396" alt="Image of male body" title="Image of male body" /></div>-->

<p>Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or 
knee. Over time, in some types of arthritis but not in all, the joints 
involved can become severely damaged.</p>

<p>There are different types of arthritis. In some diseases in which 
arthritis occurs, other organs, such as your eyes, your chest, or 
your skin, can also be affected. Some people may worry that 
arthritis means they won’t be able to work or take care of their 
children and their family. Others think that you just have to accept 
things like arthritis.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that arthritis can be painful. But there are things you 
can do to feel better. This publication tells you some facts about 
arthritis and gives you some ideas about what to do so you can 
keep doing many of the things you enjoy.</p>

<h3><a name="b" id="b"></a>What Are the Types of Arthritis?</h3>

<p>There are several types of arthritis. The two most common 
ones are osteoarthritis (AH-stee-oh-ar-THRY-tis) and rheumatoid 
(ROO-mah-toyd) arthritis.</p> 


<p>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. This condition 
usually comes with age and most often affects the fingers, knees, 
and hips. Sometimes osteoarthritis follows an injury to a joint. 
For example, a young person might hurt his knee badly playing 
soccer. Or someone might fall or be injured in a car accident. 
Then, years after the individual’s knee has apparently healed, he 
might get arthritis in his knee joint.</p>
<div class="picRight clear"><img src="graphics/MaleBody.jpg" width="125" height="396" alt="Image of male body" title="Image of male body" /></div>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis happens when the body’s own defense 
system doesn’t work properly. It affects joints and bones (often 
of the hands and feet), and may also affect internal organs and 
systems. You may feel sick or tired, and you may have a fever.</p> 

<p>Another common type of arthritis, gout, is caused by crystals that 
build up in the joints. It usually affects the big toe, but many other 
joints may be affected.</p>

<p>Arthritis is seen with many other conditions. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>lupus (LOOP-us), in which the body&rsquo;s defense system 
can harm the joints, the heart, the skin, the kidneys, 
and other organs</li>
<li>an infection that gets into a joint and destroys the cushion 
between the bones.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="c" id="c"></a>Do I Have Arthritis?</h3>

<p>Pain is the way your body tells you that something is wrong. Most 
types of arthritis cause pain in your joints. You might have trouble 
moving around. Some kinds of arthritis can affect different parts 
of your body. So, along with pain in your joints, you may:</p>

<ul>
	<li>have a fever</li>
	<li>lose weight</li>
	<li>have trouble breathing</li>
	<li>get a rash or itch.</li>
</ul>

<p>These symptoms may also be signs of other illnesses.</p>

<div class="picRight"><img src="graphics/gardening.jpg" width="215" height="261" alt="Woman gardening." title="Woman gardening" /></div>


<h3><a name="d" id="d"></a>What Can I Do?</h3>

<p>Go see a doctor. Many people use herbs or medicines that you 
can buy without a prescription for pain. You should tell your doctor 
if you do. Only a doctor can tell if you have arthritis or a related 
condition and what to do about it. It&rsquo;s important not to wait.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to tell the doctor how you feel and where you hurt. 
The doctor will examine you and may take x rays (pictures) of 
your bones or joints. The x rays don&rsquo;t hurt and aren&rsquo;t dangerous. 
You may also have to give a little blood for tests that will help the 
doctor decide what kind of arthritis you may have.</p>

<div class="picRight clear"><img src="graphics/Pat-Doc-X-ray.jpg" width="225" height="258" alt="Doctor examines x-ray with patient." title="Doctor examines x-ray with patient" /></div>


<h3><a name="e" id="e"></a>How Will the Doctor Help?</h3>

<p>After the doctor knows what kind of arthritis you have, he or she 
will talk with you about the best way to treat it. The doctor may 
give you a prescription for medicine that will help with the pain, 
stiffness, and inflammation. Health insurance or public assistance 
may help you pay for the medicine, doctor visits, tests, and x rays.</p>

<h3><a name="f" id="f"></a>How Should I Use Arthritis Medicine?</h3>

<p>Before you leave the doctor&rsquo;s office, make sure you ask about the 
best way to take the medicine the doctor prescribes. For example, 
you may need to take some medicines with milk, or you may need 
to eat something just before or after taking them, to make sure 
they don&rsquo;t upset your stomach.</p>

<p>You should also ask how often to take the medicine or to put 
cream on the spots that bother you. Creams might make your skin 
and joints feel better. Sometimes, though, they can make your 
skin burn or break out in a rash. If this happens, call the doctor.</p>

<h3><a name="g" id="g"></a>What If I Still Hurt?</h3>

<p>Sometimes you might still have pain after using your medicine. 
Here are some things to try:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a warm shower.</li>
<li>Do some gentle stretching exercises.</li>
<li>Use an ice pack on the sore area.</li>
<li>Rest the sore joint.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you still hurt after 
using your medicine 
correctly and 
doing one or more 
of these things, 
call your doctor. 
Another kind of 
medicine might 
work better for you. 
Some people can 
also benefit from 
surgery, such as 
joint replacement.</p>

<h3><a name="h" id="h"></a>You Can Feel Better!</h3>

<p>Arthritis can damage your joints, internal organs, and skin. There 
are things you can do to keep the damage from getting worse. 
They might also make you feel better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to keep your weight down. Too much weight can make 
your knees and hips hurt.</li>
<li>Exercise. Moving all of your joints will help you. The doctor 
or nurse can show you how to move more easily. Going for 
a walk every day will help, too.</li>
<li>Take your medicines 
when and how you 
are supposed to. They 
can help reduce pain 
and stiffness.</li>
<li>Try taking a warm shower in the morning.</li>
<li>See your doctor regularly.</li>
<li>Seek information that can help you.</li>
</ul>
